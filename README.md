"Time does not heal anything.
It just teaches you to live with Pain."
-->> And World Asks me !! That
"Why I love her ??"
My ANsWER remains constant As heRe :-
  Her Determination
      Fighting Spirit
          Smile Makes me too much Happy from my inner Self.
              The more I write More I feel her presence. 
                  Definitely Her presence is temporary but feel is permanent.
