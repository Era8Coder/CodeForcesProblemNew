// Avoiding LandMines Problem :-
/*
There are N cities with M
bi-directional roads between them. You want to travel 
from a given source city to target city. But there are
some cities that have landmines in them and you will die 
if you visit these cities.

Find the smallest number of roads that you can take to complete your travel 
without dying. If it is not possible to do so output âˆ’1.

Input : 
The first line contains two integers N and M denoting the number 
of cities and the number of roads respectively.

The second line contains two integers: source and target.

The third line contains N integers which are either 0 or 1
denoting whether each city has landmines or not. (1
means that the city has landmines.)

Finally, there are M
lines containing 2
integers each u
and v
denoting that there is a road between city u
and city v.
